        Modify the included project to match the mockups. Feel free to use the included 3rd party libraries if they are useful to you but please don't add any others.

        Task: Create this page: <a href="mockups/initial.png">mockups/initial.png</a>
      </p>

      <label>Details:</label>

      <ul>
        <li>Only needs to work in the latest version of Chrome.</li>
        <li>Things should line up and look symmetrical but please don't bother measuring. Just estimate heights, widths, padding etc.</li>
        <li>After adding a new celebrity, page should look like this: <a href="mockups/after_addition.png">mockups/after_addition.png</a>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't worry about persistence or AJAX or anything like that.</li>
            <li>Cards should occur in the order of addition with newest being at the top-left.</li>
            <li>Don't worry about form validation, the photo is optional.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The hover state for a card should look like this (top-left card): <a href="mockups/hover_state.png">mockups/hover_state.png</a></li>
        <li>After clicking the X as shown on hover, the card should be removed from the page, and the other cards should fall into place.</li>
        <li>Photo URL can be to any image on the internet.
          <ul>
            <li>Don't worry about proportionate scaling, just force it to a square.</li>
            <li>If no photo is provided, the default image (included) should be shown</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <ul>
        <li>Q: What would need to be done to make this an actually useful app?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It needs to do something more. At current, it's just a list of people that you can add to or delete. It has to have features. I have a couple of Ideas
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Select an employee, switch views into something more detailed about this employee. Maybe their resume, their patents, their
          contact info, more pictures, etc. 
         </li>
        <li>         
          Add another section of this page that represents a project. When you create a new project, you're able to drag and drop
          Employees into the bucket of the project. It'd be a good way to track who is on a specific project. if you were so inclined, you could add roles into each project (DEV, PM, DESIGN). It could get really awesome. 
        </li>
        <li>
          This could also be an application used to track peoples' status in meetings in real time. If, for example it exists on a mobile accessible site internally, you can have UI conventions set up for different meeting statuses (ex. "In a Meeting", "Free", "Meeting in 10 minutes"). The UI would provide a green border around Employees if they were free, and would make a slow, time-dependent transition into red as meetings they're scheduled for get closer. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Actually, expanding on my original Idea, make an internal app called "AllSpice" that acts as a status platform for employees based on their calendar. Using calendar data they can be on Vacation, in meetings, or, if you get really 1984 with it and have some sort of way to track where they are, you can determine when they've left work and gray them out in the application (maybe base it on a packet you send to their computer and if there's no response after several attempts it just marks them absent.) I'm dreaming here. BUT DREAMING IS GOOD. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> 
        It all boils down to the application serving a useful purpose with employee information. It has to make some task of the user's easier.
        I feel like my suggestions make available information that would be useful in the day to day!
      </p>


      <h4>Would you mind taking a this brief survey after completing this? There's only one question, and it won't affect your chances of future employment with Spiceworks.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Q: What did you think of this test?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I thought it was alright. I think it was a good litmus for basic DOM scripting, but I think you'd be more able to 
        sift through applicants if you supplied some more challenging 'nice to haves.' Ex. Don't mix the two vendor libraries, Use the module pattern, Use Javascript only when dealing with removing Employees (okay that just seems weird), Namespace your application code like so: <pre><code>window.spiceworks = {}</code></pre> I also think that the CSS shouldn't be minified, just because it makes everything above the user CSS look horrid, but that's just me getting nitpicky.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a second reflection, I really enjoyed the freedom I was given in developing this. I really enjoy tests like this as a rule, because
        it allows me to apply things I've learned and work towards a set of win conditions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you're going to add anything, it should just be like... "BONUS POINTS IF YOU USE/CODE ONLY WITH/COMMENT/ETC..."
