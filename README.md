# Take home tests

A collection of take home tests I've been given by various companies for Web development positions.

## [Senior Homes]((2014) senior-homes)

This is a test I was administered in early 2014 when I was heavily developing in Wordpress, it definitely showcases my noviceness as a starting point for future code improvements

## [Spiceworks](http://www.spiceworks.com/)

This is a test I was administered in 2015. I really wanted to blow out of the water, so I spent a lot of time thoroughly documenting and writing code with js design patterns I learned. 


## More to come?

I'll add more of them as I receieve them!
