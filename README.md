# Take home tests

A collection of take home tests I've been given by various companies for Web development positions.

## [Senior Homes]((2014) senior-homes)

This is a test I was administered in early 2014 when I was heavily developing in Wordpress, it definitely showcases my noviceness as a starting point for future code improvements. 

## [Flowroute]((2014) flowroute)

This is a test that came mid 2014 when I decided to appropriate a boilerplate intended for wordpress development into a standalone website with HTML/CSS/JS, my coding conventions were still slightly crude and I hadn't really taken a dive into node.js by this point, but I feel that this project still reflects growth!

## [Spiceworks]((2015) spiceworks)

This is a test I was administered in 2015. I really wanted to blow out of the water, so I spent a lot of time thoroughly documenting and writing code with js design patterns I learned. 


## More to come?

I'll add more of them as I receieve them!
